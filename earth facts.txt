 Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbour life.
 According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. 
 Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only
 natural satellite. 
 @Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known 
 as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its 
 axis about 366.26 times. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted,
 producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. The 
 gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes
 ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis,
 and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest 
 planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four 
 terrestrial planets. Earth's lithosphere is divided into
 several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the 
 surface over periods of many millions of years. About
 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly 
 by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of 
 continents and islands that together have many lakes,
 rivers and other sources of water that contribute 
 to the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar 
 regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic
 ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. 
 Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron 
 inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the
 Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle 
 that drives plate tectonics.
