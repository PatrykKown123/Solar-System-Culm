 Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. 
 Its orbital period around the Sun of 88 days is the shortest of all 
 the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity 
 Mercury, the messenger to the gods. 
 @Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun 
 within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, 
 so it can only be seen visually in the morning
 or the evening sky, and never exceeds 28° away
 from the Sun. Also, like Venus and the Moon, 
 the planet displays the complete range of 
 phases as it moves around its orbit relative
 to Earth. Seen from Earth, this cycle of 
 phases reoccurs approximately every 116 days,
 the so-called synodic period. Although Mercury
 can appear as a bright star-like object when
 viewed from Earth, its proximity to the Sun 
 often makes it more difficult to see than Venus.
