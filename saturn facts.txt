Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
@It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth 
the average density of Earth, but with its larger volume Saturn is over 95 times more massive. 
Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol represents the 
god's sickle. Saturn's interior is probably composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock 
(silicon and oxygen compounds). This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic 
hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous
outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. 
Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's 
planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times
that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth
of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived
features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph), higher than on 
Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune.
