Neptune is the eighth planet from the sun. It was the first planet to get its existence predicted by mathematical calculations before 
it was actually seen through a telescope on Sept. 23, 1846. Irregularities in the orbit of Uranus led French astronomer Alexis Bouvard 
to suggest that the gravitational pull from another celestial body might be responsible. German astronomer Johann Galle then relied on 
subsequent calculations to help spot Neptune via telescope. Previously, astronomer Galileo Galilei sketched the planet, but he mistook it
for a star due to its slow motion. In accordance with all the other planets seen in the sky, this new world was given a name from Greek 
and Roman mythology — Neptune, the Roman god of the sea.
